# R2Script
A simple compiler for "R2Script".**Still in progress.**

"R2Script" is a programming language which was designed by me.It's C-liked but no so many features are supported.  
This compiler produce .asm file which could be then assembled by the assembler.  

Here's the R2's github: [R216](https://github.com/LBPHacker/R216) where you can find the assembler.

**For the time being the code generated by the compiler would run so slowly.** But You can get a framework of the program from it then optimize it manually.
